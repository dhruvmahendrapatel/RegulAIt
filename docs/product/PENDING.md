# RegulAIt — What Is Not Built

**Status:** current as of 2026-08-03 (after PR #105, all 26 ADRs 0036–0061 built and deployed)

Every ADR 0001–0061 is **Accepted**. That means the *decision* is made and a real implementation
exists — it does **not** mean every clause of every ADR shipped. This file is the honest inventory
of what remains, so no one reads "26/26 Accepted" as "nothing left to do".

Ordered by what actually blocks a sale, not by ADR number.

## 1. The three that gate an enterprise deal

| # | Gap | Why it blocks | Where it's recorded |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **No LLM provider is connected.** The owner's key is parked by standing instruction. Dispatch runs against a mock. | Every model-dependent feature is *mechanism-proven, judgment-unverified*: LLM-as-judge (0044), the copilot's narration (0056), red-team probe grading (0057), model-backed guardrail tiers (0042). The governance, cost attribution and audit trail around them are real; the model behaviour is not exercised. | Each ADR's amendment |
| **P2** | **Single point of failure.** One EC2 box, Postgres in a container volume. Nightly verified `pg_dump` to S3 exists (0035) but HA does not. | No SLA is offerable. | [DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](../ops/DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md) |
| **P3** | **No compliance attestation** (SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / ISO 42001). Deferred by owner decision. Note the customer-facing compliance *packs* (0058) are built — selling "EU AI Act mapping" does not require us to be certified. | Procurement gate at most regulated buyers. | [ENTERPRISE_READINESS_PLAN.md](ENTERPRISE_READINESS_PLAN.md) Bucket 3 |

## 2. Security gaps found during this build — fix before a customer install

| # | Gap | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| ~~**S1**~~ | ~~**Air-gapped is not code-enforced.**~~ **CLOSED by [ADR-0062](../decisions/0062-mode-scoped-egress.md) (migration 0074).** A deployment-wide posture is derived from `REGULAIT_DEPLOY_MODE` (server-derived, following ADR-0029's reasoning that deployment shape is not an admin toggle); `org_settings` may tighten via an enum with **no loosening member**, so the ceiling holds by construction. Under `air_gapped`, a dispatch whose adapter would use its **compiled vendor default** is refused before the adapter is constructed — enforced at model dispatch, connector invoke, git stage and PM sync, proven by a willing fetch spy recording **zero** invocations. Allow-listing the vendor host in the existing `egress_allow_hosts` table lets the same call proceed, so it is a guard and not a ban. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`-style SDK overrides are now adjudicated too (they would previously have let the SDK go somewhere the guard never saw). | **Residual, still open**: `hosted` and `byoc` remain **permissive by default** — BYOC reaches real endpoints on purpose ([DATA_BOUNDARY.md](../deployment/DATA_BOUNDARY.md) §5), so strict-by-default would break existing installs; both are opt-in via the org dial. An adapter whose default base URL is not statically knowable (e.g. `snowflake`) is *refused* under strict rather than adjudicated — fails closed but coarser. Process-level egress (image pulls, ACME, cloud SDKs) is outside this guard; the network remains the stronger control. |
| ~~**S2**~~ | ~~**`REGULAIT_DATA_KEY` is not recorded out-of-band.**~~ **CLOSED by [ADR-0063](../decisions/0063-data-key-custody.md) (migration 0075).** The envelope split still stands (the key is not in the backup, on purpose); what was added is the custody procedure. A non-secret key fingerprint is recorded, printed at boot, written into every backup artifact, and the gateway **refuses to start** when the running key is not the one this deployment's ciphertext was written under. Custody is an audited attestation whose absence is reported on the boot line, in the portal and in every backup run. | **Residual, still open**: full **re-encryption** under a new key is not built — `REGULAIT_DATA_KEY_ROTATED_FROM` re-records the fingerprint and says outright that it re-encrypted nothing. A resumable, transactional walk over all twelve `CIPHERTEXT_COLUMNS` is named follow-up scope in ADR-0063 §4. And the attestation records a *claim*: the product cannot verify custody. |
| **S3** | **No real release keypair.** ADR-0041's update-bundle verifier and ADR-0052's license verifier both pin a **dev** public key whose private half was not retained. | Generate offline, rotate per `infra/release-keys/` runbook, retire the dev key. |
| **S4** | Deferred by owner decision, still open: SAST/SCA/secret-scanning in CI (D3), third-party pen test (D4), WAF/DDoS at the edge (D5), HSM/FIPS option (D7). | ENTERPRISE_READINESS_PLAN Bucket 3 |

## 3. Structural gaps — the ADR shipped, a named half did not

These are cases where an ADR is Accepted and genuinely working, but a specific clause is
**wired-but-inert** or **absent**. Each is stated in that ADR's own amendment.

| ADR | What is structural rather than behavioural |
|---|---|
| **0048** | **Largest single gap.** Rule and compliance-profile *versions* store, activate and roll back — but the kernels still read their own tables, so the **shadow canary for rules evaluates nothing**. `canaryIsLive` names the boundary and a test asserts the endpoint discloses it. Prompt versioning *is* fully live. |
| **0042** | All four detectors are **heuristic rule sets, not classifiers**. Model-based and external tiers are interface-only and unwired. `semantic_dlp` sees declared markers and secret *shapes*, not scored sensitivity. Ships at `log` by default for exactly this reason. |
| **0045** | Bias/fairness is a **declared, evidenced slot — not a measurement** (needs a provider). Per-project MRM enforcement via the §8.3 cascade did not ship. |
| **0049** | The inline pre-dispatch acceleration gate is **not built**; the framework cost floor is unit-tested but the gateway passes `null`; per-user baselines are modelled but the evaluator computes project-level only. |
| **0050** | Content-level lineage has **no cascade switch** (metadata only). Several node subtypes exist but nothing writes them. No rebuild-from-ledgers command. |
| **0052** | Only **2 of the §4 enforcement points** are wired (`enforcementPointsWired` is on the status API). Tier flags are correct and reported but **no feature reads them yet**. `deploymentMode` is recorded, not enforced. |
| **0053** | **One SDK language.** TypeScript only — Python/Go/Java are not built and not claimed. Route responses declare no schemas, so client response types are `unknown`. |
| **0054** | The **PM project/work-item importer is not built**. |
| **0055/0056/0057/0058** | Shadow-AI ingests **customer-supplied evidence only** (no traffic sniffing). The copilot's approved proposals are **not applied by anything** (no diff-applier). Red-team probes run once, not over repeated trials, and per-class gating presets aren't driven by the cascade. Compliance packs don't auto-create a `compliance_profiles` row, so the §8.3 preset half is unwired; the six launch packs carry `provenance.reviewedBy: null` — **no domain review**. |
| **0059** | Candidate is an **ABAC policy version only** — no `approval_rules`, `rate_limits` or role-grant deltas. |
| **0060** | S3 Object-Lock sink is **built but not wired** (`tamperResistant: false` is reported honestly). Measured ceiling: ~300–350 rows/s on the tip lock; concurrency does not help. |

## 4. One cross-cutting absence

**There is no in-process scheduler, anywhere.** Every "scheduled" capability is a *definition* plus
an endpoint an operator or cron must call:

- ADR-0044 eval drift sweeps · ADR-0045 MRM expiry sweep · ADR-0046 SLA breach detection ·
  ADR-0047 report schedules · ADR-0049 spend evaluation · ADR-0057 red-team runs

This was a deliberate, repeated choice — enforcement never *depends* on a sweep (MRM recomputes at
dispatch; SLA breach is caught on read and on decide) — but "scheduled" currently means
"something outside RegulAIt must call this". **It deserves one decision, not six ad-hoc ones.**

---

## 5. Test-infrastructure debt

- **`seed.test.ts` uses a fixed-name scratch database** (`regulait_seed_test`) and
  `DROP DATABASE … WITH (FORCE)` in `beforeAll`. Two concurrent suite runs on one host destroy each
  other's database. This caused spurious failures repeatedly during the build wave and is a real
  hazard for any parallel CI.
- A general rule earned the hard way: **any test mutating the `ORG_SETTINGS_ID` singleton must
  restore it**, because vitest orders files by cached previous-run duration, so adding any test file
  reshuffles the order and can surface a latent leak.

---

## 6. Commercial, deferred by owner decision

- **G5** AWS/Azure/GCP Marketplace listings · **G6** in-product support, docs portal, admin guide.
- Provider-invoice importer for genuine `reconciled` billing; extract `packages/billing-provider`
  when a second backend exists.

## Suggested order, if the goal is a first pilot

1. **S1 + S2** — the two that make an install genuinely defensible (air-gap enforcement, key custody).
2. **P1** — connect a provider; it converts a dozen "mechanism-proven" claims into verified ones.
3. **The scheduler decision** (§4) — one ADR unblocks six features' last mile.
4. **0048's rules half** — the largest single structural gap in a shipped ADR.
5. **P2** — HA, when there is a customer to serve. Not before.
